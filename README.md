Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It works similarly to how people often sort playing cards in their hands: starting with the second element, it compares it to the ones before it and inserts it into its correct position by shifting larger elements to the right. This process continues for each element until the entire array is sorted. Although insertion sort is inefficient for large datasets due to its O(nÂ²) time complexity in the average and worst cases, it performs well on small or nearly sorted arrays. It is also a stable, in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it doesn't use extra memory and preserves the order of equal elements.
